# LINEAR REGRESSION

## WHAT'S LINEAR REGRESSION?

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

## HOW LINEAR REGRESSION WORKS?

The linear regression model is represented by the following equation:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n + \epsilon $$

Where:
- $Y$ is the dependent variable
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients
- $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are the independent variables
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points. The best-fitting line is the one that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.

### USING SCIKIT-LEARN

```python
# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Training the Simple Linear Regression model on the Training set
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the Model Performance

```

### USING TENSORFLOW

```python
# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Feature Scaling
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

# Building the TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='linear')

# Compiling the TensorFlow model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Training the TensorFlow model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the Model Performance

## EXAMPLES OF LINEAR REGRESSION

- STEP 1: You have to import all the necessary libraries into your project.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

- STEP 2: You have to import the dataset into your project.

```python
dataset = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

- STEP 3: You have to split the dataset into the training set and test set.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```

- STEP 4: You have to train the simple linear regression model on the training set.

```python
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- STEP 5: You have to predict the test set results.

```python
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
```

- STEP 6: You have to evaluate the model performance.

```python
print(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

- You can also visualize the training set results.

```python
plt.scatter(X_train, y_train, color='red')
plt.plot(X_train, regressor.predict(X_train), color='blue')
plt.title('Salary vs Experience (Training set)')
plt.xlabel('Years of Experience')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()
```

- You can also visualize the test set results.

```python
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='red')
plt.plot(X_train, regressor.predict(X_train), color='blue')
plt.title('Salary vs Experience (Test set)')
plt.xlabel('Years of Experience')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()
