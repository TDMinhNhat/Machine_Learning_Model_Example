# LOGISTIC REGRESSION

## WHAT IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION?

Logistic regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables.

The logistic function is defined as:

$$ P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n)}} $$

Where:
- $P(Y=1|X)$ is the probability that the dependent variable is 1 given the values of the independent variables
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients
- $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are the independent variables
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm
- $Y$ is the dependent variable
- $X$ is the independent variable
- $n$ is the number of independent variables

The logistic function is also known as the sigmoid function, and it maps any real value into the range [0, 1]. This allows us to interpret the output of the logistic regression model as a probability.
